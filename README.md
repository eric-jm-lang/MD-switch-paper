# MD-switch-paper
Scripts and Jupyter notebooks used to study switchable states in a de novo alpha helical peptide assembly using molecular dynamics simulations.
The findings for this study are published in:

Dawson, W. D.†;Lang, E. J. M.†; Rhys, G. G.†; Shelley, K. L.†; Williams, C.; Brady, R. L.; Crump, M. P.; Mulholland, A. J.; Woolfson, D. N., 
**Structural resolution of switchable states of a *de novo* peptide assembly.** Under review in Nature Communications.

The author of the scripts is Eric J. M. Lang (eric.jm.lang at gmail.com) currently affiliated with the University of Bristol.
The trajectory files are not provided but a collection of pickled files for the intermediate calculations is included.
